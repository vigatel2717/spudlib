# SpudAudio

Thin audio endpoint I/O: WASAPI (Windows), ALSA (Linux; PipeWire planned), CoreAudio
(macOS, planned). The public API and its per-backend mappings are documented in
`include/spudaudio.h`; this file holds design notes that don't belong in the header.

## Future intent: positional (spatialized) audio

> **Status: future intent — not implemented, and not part of SpudAudio.** Spatialization
> is rendering policy, so under SpudLib's zero-policy rule it lives *above* SpudLib —
> in whatever calls it. SpudAudio's only part is
> reporting which speaker each device channel feeds
> (`SPUDAUDIO_DEVICE_PROPERTIES.native_format.positions`, and the granted
> `SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_CONFIG.format.positions`), so the layer above can render for the
> real speaker layout.

Motivating case: an application plays a sound effect from a direction relative to
where something happened in its viewport.

1. **Direction** — the clicked point relative to the camera: azimuth (left/right),
   elevation (up/down), distance. Computed by whoever owns the camera and the clicked
   geometry, above SpudLib.
2. **Spatializer** — turns that direction into a signal per output channel, mixed into
   the stream callback's buffer:

| Method | What it does | Fits when |
|---|---|---|
| **Stereo panning** (constant-power) | Click left in the viewport → louder in the left speaker | Stereo speakers/headphones. Simplest; plenty for a UI click. |
| **Binaural / HRTF** | Filters the sound the way a head and ears would, so it seems to come from a direction — including above, below, behind | Headphones, when elevation/depth should actually be audible |
| **VBAP / multichannel panning** | Distributes the sound across the nearest real speakers | 5.1 / 7.1 / Atmos setups |
| **Ambisonics** | Encodes the sound into a sound field first, then decodes it to whatever output exists | Many simultaneous sources, head tracking, or one mix for every kind of output |

For one effect per placement, **direct panning to the device's actual layout** is the
right tool: `FL FR` → stereo panning, `FL FR FC LFE RL RR SL SR` → 7.1 panning, no
layout → a fallback the caller chooses. Ambisonics earns its complexity only with many
concurrent sources or a moving listener (VR).

Two practical constraints when this gets built:

- **Latency matters more than the panning method.** A click sound must land within
  roughly 20–30 ms of the click or it feels detached — favouring WASAPI's low-latency
  shared path (`IAudioClient3`) and small periods. `SPUDAUDIO_CALLBACK_INFO::host_time_ns`
  (same clock as `spudperf_get_monotonic_time_ns`) lets the mixer schedule the sound
  against the actual click time.
- **It doubles as an accessibility feature** — hearing *where* something landed is a
  cue in its own right.

### Why ambisonics isn't a channel position

Every `SPUDAUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION` names a speaker. Ambisonic channels (W
omnidirectional, X/Y/Z front-back/left-right/up-down; (order + 1)² channels in total)
describe a sound field and are each mixed into *every* speaker by a decoder, so
labelling them as positions would misdescribe them. CoreAudio's ambisonic labels
therefore read back as `AUX`. If ambisonic streams are ever carried as such, they need
their own per-format layout kind (speaker positions vs. ambisonic order + channel
ordering + normalization), not more position labels.

## TODO: let the caller see and decide what OS conversion does (CoreAudio)

`SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_FLAG_ALLOW_OS_CONVERSION` on CoreAudio puts an `AudioConverter`
between the stream's format and the device's. Today the flag is one bit: the caller
can allow conversion, but can't see what was converted or choose how. Each item below
is a decision the backend currently makes, or a fact it currently keeps to itself.

**Where this should go:** SpudAudio reports every one of these differences between
what was asked for and what the device does, and the caller makes every choice among
them. Nothing below should stay a built-in default.

- [ ] **Whether a stream is converted at all.** A format that already is the device's
  is not converted, flag or no flag, and `SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_CONFIG` doesn't say which
  happened. Report it, along with the device-side format (sample rate, channel count,
  layout) the stream is being converted to or from.
- [ ] **Channel routing when the channel counts differ.** No channel map and no mix
  are set, so the converter's default applies: stream channel n is device channel n,
  and channels past the device's are discarded (OUTPUT) or silent (INPUT). Mono into a
  stereo device plays on the left only; stereo into mono drops the right channel.
  Report the routing in use, and let the caller supply a channel map or ask for a mix
  (`kAudioConverterChannelMap`, `kAudioConverterPropertyPerformDownmix`,
  `kAudioConverterPropertyChannelMixMap`).
- [ ] **Channel layout.** A requested layout must equal the one that default routing
  gives (the device's positions for shared channels, `NA` for the rest) or the stream
  is refused. Let the caller hand both layouts to the converter
  (`kAudioConverterInputChannelLayout` / `kAudioConverterOutputChannelLayout`) when it
  wants a different one.
- [ ] **The device's I/O buffer size.** The stream's period is in its own frames; the
  device's buffer is set to the nearest whole number of device frames that lasts as
  long. The rounding is the backend's and the result isn't reported. Report the device
  period that was granted, and let the caller state it or the rounding.
- [ ] **How the callback is driven.** The callback always gets exactly `period_frames`
  from a buffer of the backend's, zero or more times per device I/O cycle, because with
  a rate change the two sets of frames don't line up. Report that the stream is driven
  this way, and how many device frames one I/O cycle is, so the caller can tell a
  re-chunked stream from a direct one.
- [ ] **Timing that leaves out the converter.** `host_time_ns` is the I/O cycle's host
  time moved by the period's offset in the cycle, and
  `spudaudio_stream_get_latency_frames()` is the HAL's total restated in stream frames.
  Neither includes the converter's own delay. Report that delay separately.
- [ ] **Converter quality and priming.** Sample-rate converter quality and the prime
  method are left at the converter's defaults. Report what is in use and let the caller
  set them.
- [ ] **A device rate change ends the stream.** The converter was built for the old
  rate, so the stream moves to `SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_STATE_ERROR` with
  `SPUDRESULT_SAUD_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED`, the same as an unconverted stream. That is
  already reported; whether a converted stream could instead be offered the new rate
  is the caller's choice to add.

Verification still owed, separate from the above:

- [ ] The CoreAudio conversion path has not been compiled or run.
- [ ] `SPUDAUDIO_SAMPLE_FORMAT_S24_32_LSB` may be refused: `AudioConverter` only
  promises non-packed integers that are high-aligned. If it is, the stream fails with
  `SPUDRESULT_SAUD_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

WASAPI (`AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_AUTOCONVERTPCM`) and ALSA (plugins) convert inside the
platform and hide the same kinds of difference. Whatever shape the reporting takes
should cover them too, so one description of "what was converted and how" works on
every backend.
