# SpudLib

Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). This is a from-scratch
translation layer over GPU, file system, memory, network, and audio primitives — a general HAL,
not a GPU library with utilities bolted on. See `../CLAUDE.md` (the `eqdev` workspace
root) for how this repo fits into the workspace; this file covers
conventions specific to working inside `spudlib` itself.

## The one rule everything else follows

**SpudLib is pure mechanism, zero policy.** It translates a platform/GPU API into a
consistent C interface and stops there. It never makes a decision on the caller's
behalf, never has a default that hides a choice, and holds no global state.

- Expose enumeration/query functions so the caller can inspect and
  decide — `spudgpu_enumerate_devices`, not `spudgpu_select_best_device`.
- No "convenience" fallback that picks something for the caller. If a change feels
  like it wants one, that decision belongs to the caller, not here.
- Everything flows through explicit handles the caller owns and passes in — no
  library-owned globals.
- If a bug turns out to be SpudLib silently defaulting instead of translating a
  caller-supplied parameter (e.g. `spudgpu_create_image_view` once hardcoded
  `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT` regardless of what the caller asked for), that's a
  design-principle violation, not just a bug — fix it by passing the real parameter
  through, not by adding a special case.
- When a fix spans SpudLib and its caller, make the correct structural change on
  both sides rather than working around a layering gap from one side only.
- **SpudLib doesn't know who calls it.** Nothing here - code, comments, headers,
  docs - names a caller or assumes which one it is. Write "the caller".

## Module map

Every module returns the shared `SPUDRESULT` enum (`spudcore.h`, ~90 named error
codes) rather than inventing its own error convention.

| Module | Header | Prefix | Backends |
|---|---|---|---|
| SpudGPU | `spudgpu.h` | `spudgpu_` | Vulkan, D3D12, Metal |
| SpudFiles | `spudfiles.h` | `sfs_` | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| SpudMemory | `spudmemory.h` | `smem_` | Windows, Linux |
| SpudNet | `spudnet.h` | `spudnet_` | TCP sockets: Winsock2, BSD sockets (Linux + Apple, one file). HTTP + WebSocket: WinHTTP, libcurl, NSURLSession |
| SpudAudio | `spudaudio.h` | `spudaudio_` / `SPUDRESULT_SAUD_*` | WASAPI (Windows), ALSA (Linux), CoreAudio (macOS); an argument-checking stub where no API is compiled in (iOS, watchOS) |
| SpudCore | `spudcore.h` | `spud_` / `SPUDRESULT` | platform-agnostic |
| SpudPerf | `spudperf.h` | `spudperf_` | Windows, Linux |

SpudGPU dominates the codebase (92 functions across 20 opaque handles) and is where
most work happens. The others are small, focused translation shims — don't let their
API surface grow beyond what they are: SpudNet is "move bytes," not a networking
framework (message framing, snapshot/delta semantics, host authority are all
the caller's problem). All three parts share one shape, set out at the
top of `spudnet.h` - `spudnet_<object>_<verb>` names, `_create`/`_destroy`, desc
structs with no defaults, one meaning for `timeout_ms` (`SPUDNET_NO_WAIT` stands in
for a non-blocking mode), `_abort` from any thread, and `SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_*`
results - so a new call follows it rather than the platform API it wraps. TCP
addresses are numeric; name lookup is its own object (`spudnet_resolver`) because
the system's lookup can't be time-limited or interrupted: `spudnet_resolver_run`
blocks in it on a thread the caller supplies, `spudnet_resolver_wait` waits for
the answer on another. SpudNet itself starts no thread, anywhere. The HTTP and WebSocket clients follow the same
rule one level up: they translate the platform's own client stack (TLS, proxies and
framing are the stack's) and carry one request or one message, with every call
blocking on the caller's thread. HTTP is a streaming transfer
(`spudnet_http_transfer`: start, send the body in pieces, receive the response,
recv its body in pieces) - nothing of the caller's is buffered in SpudNet, and
there is no one-shot request to add back. Each backend keeps the caller's time limit itself,
as the whole call's allowance, with the stack's own timers switched off - don't hand
a limit to WinHTTP/NSURLSession/libcurl, they each mean something different by it -
and each blocking call can be ended from another thread
(`spudnet_http_transfer_abort`, `spudnet_websocket_abort`). Which server
certificates are accepted is the caller's, in a `spudnet_tls_desc` (trust mode,
DER roots, host-name switch, SHA-256 public-key pins) given per HTTP client and
per WebSocket connect; a zeroed one is the stack's own check. A failure's
`SPUDRESULT` is portable and the platform's own number behind it is not, so
each object keeps the latter in a `spudnet_error` for its `_get_error` - for
logs, never for deciding what to do - and a backend records it at the point it
returns the failure (`spudnet_error_record`). Waiting on several objects at
once is a `spudnet_wait_set` (`src/net/spudnetwaitset.c`, one `poll()`-based file
for every platform): it only says which objects are worth calling, and the
caller still makes the ordinary calls with `SPUDNET_NO_WAIT`. No retry, no
reconnect, no cookies, no keep-alive pings, and nothing that knows what a status
code or a message means. What is the same on every stack is written once: the
HTTP transfer's order of use, checks and header storage in
`src/net/spudnethttp.c`, with each stack behind the `spudnet_http_backend_*`
functions of `src/net/spudnetshared.h`; a new rule about a transfer goes in the
front end, not in three backends. Parts a platform doesn't allow are compiled
out by `SPUDNET_EXT_TCP` / `SPUDNET_EXT_WEBSOCKET` (both 0 on watchOS) - test
those, never a platform's name. SpudMemory is
reserve/commit/decommit + an arena allocator, not a general allocator library.
SpudAudio is "move PCM frames to and from an endpoint," not an audio engine: no
mixer, decoder, resampler, voices, spatialisation or volume policy (those are
the caller's). It never picks a device - the OS defaults
are reported as a property - and never silently converts a format: a stream the
endpoint can't take fails with `SPUDRESULT_SAUD_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED` unless the
caller set `SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_FLAG_ALLOW_OS_CONVERSION`. Which native APIs are built
in is decided in `CMakeLists.txt` and published as PUBLIC
`SPUDAUDIO_PLATFORM_*` / `SPUDAUDIO_COMPILE_*` definitions, so a caller tests those
at compile time; the table is at the top of `spudaudio.h`.

## SpudGPU conventions

- **Opaque handles only.** Every resource type (`spudgpu_instance`, `spudgpu_device`,
  `spudgpu_buffer`, `spudgpu_command_list`, ...) is a forward-declared pointer with no
  caller-visible fields. Backend-private struct layout lives in an internal header per
  backend (`spudgpuvulkan.h`, `spudgpud3d12.hpp`) — never in the public `spudgpu.h`.
- **Dynamic rendering, not render-pass objects, as the default path.** The renderpass
  concept was removed in favor of `spudgpu_cmd_begin_rendering`/`cmd_end_rendering`
  (commit `e90f921`). Don't reintroduce a `VkRenderPass`/`VkFramebuffer`-style object
  into the public API as the default — D3D12's backend already emulates this begin/end
  shape on top of its native render-target-view binding, not the other way around.
  **Designed, not built:** no `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_*` macro, `spudgpu_framebuffer` or
  `spudgpu_cmd_begin_rendering_legacy` exists in the code yet; the rest of this
  bullet is the plan for when one is needed.
  If/when SpudLib targets hardware that lacks Vulkan 1.3/`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`
  (older/low-end Android, Wear OS smartwatches), the classic `VkRenderPass`/
  `VkFramebuffer` fallback this implies would be reached only through `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_*`
  (see below) — `spudgpu_cmd_begin_rendering`/`spudgpu_rendering_begin_desc` keep an
  identical calling convention on both paths, but the fallback itself would be exposed as a
  small opaque `spudgpu_framebuffer` handle (`SPUDGPU_LEGACY_FRAMEBUFFER`-gated,
  paired with `spudgpu_cmd_begin_rendering_legacy`) rather than hidden entirely
  inside the Vulkan backend. That object needs a real owner for its lifetime
  (creation, caching, invalidation on resize) — a private SpudLib-side cache keyed on
  attachment sets would be exactly the hidden global state/hidden decision the
  zero-policy rule above forbids. The owner is the caller: it holds raw image views
  on modern hardware or a `spudgpu_framebuffer` it created and caches on legacy
  hardware, and makes the same begin/end call either way.
- **`SPUDGPU_EXT_*` gates a capability gap between backends; `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_*`
  (designed, not built) gates one extra caller-owned object for constrained hardware
  within a backend.**
  Both are compile-time macros in `spudgpu.h`, computed once and gated on everywhere
  else — never scatter a raw `#if !SPUDGPU_COMPILE_<BACKEND>` check across call
  sites; if a second backend later lacks the same thing, that should be a one-line
  edit to the macro's own definition, not an audit of every use site. They answer
  different questions and must not be conflated:
  - `SPUDGPU_EXT_<NAME>` gates a capability that some `GRAPHICS_BACKEND` choices
    don't implement at all (bindless/descriptor indexing is the reference example —
    Metal needs a `MTLHeap`-backed allocator it doesn't have yet). Define it `1` only
    when a backend that implements it is the one compiled in
    (`SPUDGPU_COMPILE_VULKAN_API || SPUDGPU_COMPILE_D3D12_API`-style), `0` otherwise,
    and wrap the entire public function/type group in `#if SPUDGPU_EXT_<NAME>` so
    calling it against a build that lacks it is a compile/link error, not a silent
    no-op or a runtime NULL surprise discovered on the wrong platform. Pair every
    `SPUDGPU_EXT_<NAME>` with a `SPUDRESULT_GPU_EXT_<NAME>_NOT_SUPPORTED` in
    `spudcore.h`, returned when the backend compiles the extension in but the
    specific device/driver still doesn't support it — a distinct, later-discovered
    case from the macro itself being `0`. Ray tracing and
    `SPUDGPU_EXT_DESCRIPTOR_SETS`/`SPUDGPU_EXT_SUBPASS_MERGING` (see the OpenGL note
    below) are the next likely candidates whenever their real API surface gets
    built. An `EXT` has to stay a narrow, self-contained island (a handful of
    types/functions) — if gating a capability would mean wrapping most of
    `spudgpu_cmd_*` or another load-bearing chunk of the header, that's a sign the
    backend needs its own `GRAPHICS_BACKEND` entry instead of an `EXT` flag draped
    over nearly everything.
  - `SPUDGPU_EXT_MESH_SHADING` (`SpudGPUMeshShaders` sample) is a second, distinct
    flavor of the same pattern: the macro itself is `1` on **every** backend — mesh
    shading has no structural per-backend gap the way bindless does — so the compile
    flag alone doesn't do the interesting work here. What still needs the full
    `EXT` treatment is *runtime* hardware/driver support, which genuinely varies even
    though the backend code exists on all three: Vulkan probes
    `VK_EXT_mesh_shader`'s presence and `VkPhysicalDeviceMeshShaderFeaturesEXT` at
    device-creation time (`spudgpuvulkancontext.c`, the first optional device
    extension this backend has ever had to enumerate rather than assume), D3D12
    checks `D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS7::MeshShaderTier`
    (`spudgpud3d12context.cpp`), and only Metal's is unconditionally true (Metal 3
    mesh shading is guaranteed on every Apple Silicon target this backend already
    requires). `spudgpu_get_mesh_shading_capabilities` and
    `SPUDRESULT_GPU_EXT_MESH_SHADING_NOT_SUPPORTED` exist precisely to surface that
    per-device fact to the caller — don't assume `SPUDGPU_EXT_MESH_SHADING == 1`
    means a given device can actually draw with it.
  - `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_<NAME>` gates a fallback for hardware that some devices *within*
    a single backend's target range lack, even though every *currently* targeted
    device of that backend has it (dynamic rendering on old/low-end Vulkan hardware
    is the motivating case). This is a runtime device fact, not a `GRAPHICS_BACKEND`
    choice — the same compiled Vulkan backend has to run on both old and new
    hardware — so `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_<NAME>` must gate an opt-in build configuration for
    targeting that constrained hardware profile (e.g. a dedicated CMake option),
    never `GRAPHICS_BACKEND` itself. Which path a given device actually needs is
    surfaced to the caller as a capability query (mirroring
    `spudgpu_bindless_capabilities::supported`), never resolved silently inside
    SpudLib — the caller decides which path to take per-device; SpudLib only reports
    the fact and does the mechanical object construction for whichever path is
    chosen. `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_<NAME>` may grow the public surface by exactly one
    narrow, opaque resource type when the fallback needs a persistent object with
    real lifetime (`SPUDGPU_LEGACY_FRAMEBUFFER` above) — that's still fundamentally
    different from `EXT`: the caller isn't adapting its behavior, it's just holding
    the handle SpudLib needs to do the identical job on older hardware.
- **OpenGL/OpenGL ES, if ever needed, is a fourth `GRAPHICS_BACKEND`
  (`SPUDGPU_COMPILE_OPENGL_API`), not reached through `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_*`.** Its gap
  from Vulkan/D3D12/Metal isn't one narrow fallback object — no true deferred
  command-list recording, no descriptor-set object, different synchronization
  primitives — which is a structural, broad difference, not a hardware-SKU fact
  within an existing backend. Express it the same way Metal's missing bindless is
  expressed today: a pile of `SPUDGPU_EXT_<NAME>` macros going to `0` for it
  (`SPUDGPU_EXT_DESCRIPTOR_SETS` is the clearest candidate), computed alongside
  Vulkan/D3D12/Metal as a genuine fourth backend choice — never squeezed under
  `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_*`'s opt-in constrained-hardware path, which exists for one small
  caller-owned object, not a structurally different API.
- **Backend file split mirrors the header, not guessed.** Each backend (Vulkan, D3D12,
  Metal) uses the same ten-file-per-concern layout: `context`, `buffer`, `image`,
  `shader`, `swapchain`, `descriptors`, `command`, `renderpass`, `native`, `sync`. If
  `spudgpu.h` grows a new concern, split a new file for it in every backend rather than
  dumping new functions into an existing one.
- **A fence is a counter that only goes up, on every backend.** A submission
  signals it to a value the caller chooses
  (`spudgpu_submit_desc::signal_fence_value`), `spudgpu_wait_for_fences` waits
  for a value per fence, and there is no reset: a fence is reused by
  signaling it higher. That is `ID3D12Fence` and `MTLSharedEvent` as they
  are, and a timeline `VkSemaphore` on Vulkan - not a `VkFence`, which is one
  bit that has to be reset by hand and would make the same call behave
  differently per backend. SpudGPU keeps no counter of its own for a caller's
  fence; don't add one. The swap chain's own per-frame fences are internal to
  each backend (plain `VkFence`s on Vulkan, since acquire can't take a
  timeline semaphore) and are not `spudgpu_fence`s: a submission reaches them
  through `spudgpu_submit_desc::swap_chain`, which is also all that
  `spudgpu_submit_command_lists_synced` is. Written 2026-10-10, not compiled
  on any backend. `spudgpu_semaphore` is still binary on Vulkan and a hidden
  counter on D3D12 and Metal.
- **Native escape hatches are interop-only.** `spudgpu_vulkan_natives.h` /
  `_d3d12_natives.h` / `_metal_natives.h` unwrap a handle back to its raw native type
  (`VkInstance`, `ID3D12Device14`, ...) for third-party libraries SpudLib doesn't wrap
  itself (ImGui, RenderDoc). SpudLib has no visibility into what the caller does with
  the handle afterward — that's the point, don't add tracking/validation around it.
- **Metal's natives header is not a 1:1 mirror of Vulkan/D3D12** — these asymmetries
  are deliberate, worked out before any Metal implementation exists, don't "fix" them
  later thinking they're gaps:
  - No instance-equivalent accessor (`MTLCopyAllDevices()` replaces it)
  - No physical/logical device split (`id<MTLDevice>` covers both)
  - No queue-family-index accessor (Metal queues aren't partitioned into families)
  - No command-allocator accessor (command buffers come fresh from the queue each time)
  - Buffer/image views aren't distinct native types (raw offset/stride binding; a
    texture view is just another `id<MTLTexture>`)
  - No root-signature accessor (binding indices come from `[[buffer(n)]]`/
    `[[texture(n)]]` shader attributes)
  - Fences map to `id<MTLSharedEvent>` (needs CPU wait/signal/read plus
    cross-process sharing); semaphores map to plain `id<MTLEvent>` (GPU-only
    wait/signal across queues, which is all `spudgpu_semaphore`'s public API
    ever asks for). Neither uses `MTLFence` — it can't be waited on from the
    CPU or across command queues, and belongs in `spudgpu_cmd_pipeline_barrier`'s
    implementation instead, not in fence/semaphore.

## Code conventions

- **Argument checks are one `if` per distinct return.** They sit at the top of
  the function, in parameter order, before any allocation or platform call, and
  each returns the `SPUDRESULT` that names exactly what was wrong:

  ```c
  if (!device) return SPUDRESULT_GPU_INVALID_DEVICE;
  if (!desc) return SPUDRESULT_NULL_DESC;
  ```

  Conditions that would return different values are never joined. A joined check
  can only return one code, so the caller can't tell which argument failed, and
  SpudLib's job is to report the fact, not a summary of it.
- **Conditions may be joined with `||` when every one of them leads to the same
  return** - the same `SPUDRESULT`, or the same `bool`, null or plain `return`
  from a `void` function:

  ```c
  // device null: stops at !device, device->_bindless is never read.
  if (!device || !device->_bindless) return;
  // path null: stops at !path, path[0] is never read.
  if (!path || !path[0]) return false;
  ```

  `||` evaluates left to right and stops at the first true condition, in every C
  and C++ standard, so a later condition may rely on an earlier one: put the
  pointer check before the check that dereferences it.
- **Conditions may be joined with `&&` when the branch needs all of them to
  hold.** `&&` evaluates left to right as well and stops at the first false
  condition, so each condition guards the ones after it:

  ```cpp
  // result null: stops at result, GetErrorBuffer is never called.
  // GetErrorBuffer fails: stops there, errors is never read.
  // errors null: stops at errors, GetBufferSize is never called.
  if (result && SUCCEEDED(result->GetErrorBuffer(&errors)) && errors && errors->GetBufferSize())
  	printf("spudgpu: DXC compile failed (%ls): %s\n", profile,
  	    (const char *)errors->GetBufferPointer());
  else
  	printf("spudgpu: DXC compile failed (%ls): hr=0x%08lx\n", profile, (unsigned long)hr);
  ```

  Any condition being false takes the same `else`, which is what makes joining
  them correct. If two of them need different handling, they are separate `if`s.
- The shared return must be the right one for each condition on its own. Don't
  choose a vaguer code so that two checks can share a line; if one of them later
  earns a more specific code, split the line then.
- Some existing code joins checks that should return different codes. Split one
  only when you are already changing that function.
- **A function returns the same value for the same condition in every backend.**
  The header declares it once and the caller cannot see which backend is linked,
  so a null argument, a zero count or an out-of-range index gets the same result
  from all of them. That means the same checks, returning the same codes, in the
  same order - order matters, because it decides which code comes back when two
  arguments are wrong at once.

  ```c
  // spudgpu_submit_command_lists_synced, identical in Vulkan, D3D12 and Metal.
  if (!queue) return SPUDRESULT_GPU_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE;
  if (!cmd_lists) return SPUDRESULT_GPU_INVALID_COMMAND_LIST;
  if (cmd_list_count == 0) return SPUDRESULT_ZERO_SIZE;
  if (!swap_chain) return SPUDRESULT_GPU_INVALID_SWAP_CHAIN;
  ```

  This covers every kind of return, not only `SPUDRESULT`: where one backend
  returns `false`, null or 0 for a condition, the others do too, and a `void`
  function that returns early in one returns early in all.
- A check is changed in every backend in the same change. If the backends
  already disagree, decide which answer is correct and move all of them to it;
  the reference backend is the one to build against first, not the one that wins
  a disagreement.
- What may differ is what only one platform can produce: a failed platform call
  (`SPUDRESULT_API_SPECIFIC_FAILURE`), or a feature a backend doesn't have,
  which is reported through the result code or capability query the header
  documents for it.
- **Check the handle, not what is inside it.** A create call either returns a
  fully formed object or fails and returns none: every native object the handle
  needs is created, and its result checked, before the handle is handed out. A
  function that takes a handle checks the handle argument and then uses its
  members directly.

  ```cpp
  if (!cmd) return;
  cmd->_d3d_cmd_list->SetGraphicsRoot32BitConstants(...);
  ```

  Don't add `if (!cmd->_d3d_cmd_list)` at the point of use. It can only be null
  if the create call let a half-built object out, and a check there hides that
  bug instead of reporting it. Fix the create call.
- Where it helps to state the invariant, assert it:
  `assert(cmd->_d3d_cmd_list);`. An assert documents what create guarantees and
  compiles out of release builds; it is not a substitute for checking the handle
  argument.
- The exception is a member that is created lazily, after the handle exists (in
  the D3D12 backend: `_rtv_heap`, `_dsv_heap`, `_bindless`, the indirect command
  signatures). Null is a valid state for those, so the function that uses one
  checks it and creates it there.
- **No allocating `new` and no `delete` in the C++ backends: allocate and free by
  hand.** Which allocator depends on whether the object's type has a constructor.
- **A type with a constructor:** `malloc`, check the pointer, then construct the
  object in place in that memory. `malloc`, not `calloc`, because the constructor
  is what initialises it. The in-place form needs `<new>`.

  ```cpp
  spudgpu_buffer_d3d12 *object = (spudgpu_buffer_d3d12 *)malloc(sizeof(spudgpu_buffer_d3d12));
  if (!object) return SPUDRESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
  object = new (object) spudgpu_buffer_d3d12();
  ```

  It is destroyed the same two steps in reverse: the destructor called explicitly,
  then `free`.

  ```cpp
  object->~spudgpu_buffer_d3d12();
  free(object);
  ```
- **A type with no constructor:** `calloc`, check the pointer, and that is all.
  The zeroed memory is its initial state, and nothing is constructed. It is
  destroyed with `free` alone.

  ```cpp
  spudgpu_buffer_view_d3d12 *object = (spudgpu_buffer_view_d3d12 *)calloc(1, sizeof(spudgpu_buffer_view_d3d12));
  if (!object) return SPUDRESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
  ```
- "Has a constructor" includes a type that only has members which do: a struct
  holding a `std::vector` or a `ComPtr` must be constructed in place and have its
  destructor called, or those members are never set up or released. In the D3D12
  backend that is most handle structs (instance, device, queue, allocator, command
  list, buffer, image, shader module, both pipelines, fence, semaphore, descriptor
  pool, swap chain). The plain ones are the buffer view, image view, sampler,
  descriptor set layout, descriptor set and surface.
- Every allocation has exactly one matching release, on every failure path as well
  as in the destroy call.
- A failed allocation is then a null pointer the function turns into a
  `SPUDRESULT`, where an allocating `new` would throw, and no exception may cross
  SpudLib's C boundary.
- The D3D12 backend follows this throughout: no allocating `new`, `delete` or
  `delete[]` is left in it, and every `malloc`/`calloc` is checked. Keep both ends
  of an allocation in step - memory from an allocating `new` must never reach
  `free`, nor `malloc` memory reach `delete`.
- Objects with no destroy call of their own are released by their owner: a
  device, its command queues and its bindless state by `spudgpu_destroy_instance`;
  descriptor sets by their pool, on reset and on destroy; a swap chain's back
  buffer images and views by the swap chain.
- What is left: `std::vector` and `std::string` (function locals in
  `spudgpud3d12context.cpp`, `spudgpud3d12command.cpp`, `spudgpud3d12renderpass.cpp`
  and `spudgpud3d12shader.cpp`, and the bindless free stacks) still allocate
  through the standard allocator, which reports failure by throwing.
- **In a debug build, a debug name is copied, never kept as the caller's
  pointer.** `debug_name` fields and the name member of a handle exist only
  under `#if _DEBUG`. Every handle that carries a name has it as its first
  member (`_debug_name` in SpudGPU, `debug_name` in SpudAudio, SpudNet and
  SpudFiles), and that member is either null or a copy SpudLib allocated. The
  caller may free or reuse its own string as soon as the call that took it
  returns. Storing the pointer (`pResult->_debug_name = desc->debug_name;`)
  ties the object to memory SpudLib does not own.
- **`spud_debug_name_set` (`spudcore.c`) is the one place a name is copied.**
  It frees the name the object had, stores a copy of the new one, and returns
  `SPUDRESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY` if the copy fails. A create call whose desc has a
  `debug_name` calls it; so does a caller renaming an object later.

  ```c
  #if _DEBUG
  	if (spud_debug_name_set(pResult, desc->debug_name) != SPUD_SUCCESS) {
  		spudgpu_destroy_buffer(pResult);
  		return SPUDRESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
  	}
  	pResult->_desc.debug_name = pResult->_debug_name;
  #endif
  ```
- A null `debug_name` stays null: there is nothing to copy and it is not an
  error.
- The copy is the last step of the create call, after every native object
  exists, so a failed copy releases the finished object through its own destroy
  call and returns `SPUDRESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY`.
- A handle that also keeps the caller's desc (`_desc = *desc`) points
  `_desc.debug_name` at the handle's copy. The struct copy alone still carries
  the caller's pointer, and a `spudgpu_get_*_desc` call would hand it back.
- **Because the setter frees the old name, a handle's name member must be null
  from the moment the handle exists.** Allocate with `calloc`, or copy from a
  zeroed struct, or value-initialise (`new (p) T()`); a handle from a bare
  `malloc` sets the member to null itself.
- **Whatever frees a handle frees its name first:** the destroy call, or the
  owner for a handle with no destroy call of its own (a device and its queues,
  descriptor sets, a swap chain's images, views, semaphores and fences). In C++
  the name is freed before the destructor is called.
- A name that is only passed to a platform call during the create call, and not
  stored, needs no copy.

## Backend status

- **Vulkan** — reference backend, plain C23, complete. Build against this first;
  D3D12 and Metal follow its shape.
- **D3D12** — complete, C++26. Cross-compiles the project's SPIR-V shaders to HLSL at
  runtime via **SPIRV-Cross**, built from source through `FetchContent` (deliberately
  not the Vulkan SDK's prebuilt libs — those are release-only `/MD` and mismatch a
  `/MDd` debug build; building from source lets it inherit `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`
  correctly). Also pulls in Microsoft's vendored `d3dx12.h` (3,400+ lines, not
  authored here — don't "clean up" or reformat it as if it were project code).
- **Metal** — implemented, all ten backend `.m` files, now that Apple hardware is
  available to validate against. Swap chain creation/present is verified end-to-end
  on real hardware (Apple M5 Pro) via `spudgpusamples/Samples/HelloTriangle`; the
  natives-header asymmetries above were worked out ahead of the implementation and
  held. Buffer/image copy (`spudgpu_cmd_copy_buffer`/`_copy_buffer_to_image`/
  `_copy_image_to_buffer`, `spudgpu_get_image_buffer_copy_size`) is also real now,
  via a new `_active_blit_encoder` on the command list following the same
  end-any-other-active-encoder-first pattern as `_active_compute_encoder` — verified
  end-to-end via `spudgpusamples/Samples/HelloTexture`'s texture upload, which
  silently rendered solid black until this landed (these were unimplemented
  placeholders before, per the file comment in `spudgpumetalrenderpass.m`).
  `spudgpu_cmd_blit_image` remains an unimplemented placeholder — no caller needs it
  yet.

## Build system

- `GRAPHICS_BACKEND` is a single-choice CMake cache variable (`Vulkan` / `D3D12` /
  `Metal`) — there is no multi-backend build. The source list is assembled per-platform
  and per-backend *before* `add_library`, so only one backend's translation units ever
  compile in.
- `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` is **not** set here — it must already be force-set by
  the parent `eqdev` root `CMakeLists.txt` before `add_subdirectory(spudlib)` runs (see
  `../CLAUDE.md`). If you're building `spudlib` standalone rather than through the
  workspace root, set it yourself before configuring, matching whatever
  it will be linked with uses, or Debug builds will fail to link once combined.
- SDL3 integration is header-only glue (`spudgpu_sdl3.h`) — one inline
  `spudgpu_create_surface_from_sdl3` per backend (wraps `SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface` on
  Vulkan, reads the raw `HWND` off SDL's window properties on D3D12). Don't grow this
  into a real SDL abstraction; it exists only to bridge surface creation.
- `.clang-format` is LLVM-based with tab indentation (`UseTab: ForIndentation`,
  `TabWidth`/`IndentWidth` 4), always-one-param-per-line, 160-column limit, and aligned
  consecutive assignments. Run it before committing.

## Rust bindings (`bindings/rust/`)

Independent Cargo workspace, **not** wired through CMake — `spudlib-sys`'s `build.rs`
compiles the Vulkan backend's `.c` files directly via the `cc` crate. It currently only
lists five of the ten Vulkan source files (context, swapchain, buffer, image, shader —
missing command, descriptors, renderpass, native, sync), and the safe `spudlib` wrapper
crate only covers `Instance`/`Device`/`Buffer`/`Image`/`ImageView`/`SwapChain`/
`CommandList` — no shader pipelines, descriptor sets, or fences/semaphores yet. This gap
is expected (built incrementally against what a minimal triangle-draw path needs), not
a regression to fix reflexively — extend it deliberately when a real Rust consumer
needs the next piece, matching the C API's existing shape rather than inventing a new
one.

## Working with in-progress changes

- If a fix/edit request touches a file that already has uncommitted work in
  progress (yours from an earlier session, or the user's own local changes),
  check `git diff` first. If the new fix's lines don't overlap that WIP, apply
  it directly to the working tree rather than isolating it on a separate
  branch/PR — that's extra ceremony for something that's going to land in the
  same working copy anyway. Only fall back to a standalone branch/PR when the
  tree is clean, or ask before proceeding if the fix's lines genuinely
  conflict with the WIP. Never discard or clobber the existing uncommitted
  work to make room for a fix.

## Known gaps (don't re-flag as surprises)

- The debug name rule (see "In a debug build, a debug name is copied") was
  applied to every module on 2026-10-09. Two kinds of Vulkan handle have no
  release path at all, so a name given to one is never freed either: the queue
  `spudgpu_get_graphics_queue` returns, and the sets from
  `spudgpu_create_descriptor_sets`.
- Cross-backend return values (see "A function returns the same value for the
  same condition in every backend") were aligned across SpudGPU and SpudAudio on
  2026-10-09; SpudFiles, SpudMemory and SpudNet already matched. What still
  differs in SpudGPU, each a gap in one backend and not a choice:
  - Vulkan has no `spudgpu_get_command_queue` or `spudgpu_get_max_queue_count`;
    Metal has no `spudgpu_get_shader_pipeline_desc`, bundle or bindless calls;
    D3D12 has no `spudgpu_create_surface_from_callback` or swap chain
    semaphore getters.
  - D3D12's `spudgpu_cmd_begin_rendering` returns early without a colour
    attachment, so a depth-only pass renders on Vulkan and Metal only.
  - Metal's `spudgpu_create_swap_chain` rejects `buffer_count != 1` and
    `SPUDGPU_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX`, and its pipeline rejects geometry and
    tessellation modules.
- SpudFiles' macOS backend (`spudfilesapple.c`) is plain C: file I/O is the same
  POSIX code as Linux, and dialogs run `/usr/bin/osascript` (`choose file` /
  `choose file name` / `choose folder`) rather than AppKit, so the save dialog
  always prompts before overwriting regardless of `SFS_FILE_DIALOG_FLAG_OVERWRITE_PROMPT`.
- SpudNet was written on 2026-10-07 and its header reworked, and every backend
  rewritten to it, on 2026-10-08: streaming HTTP transfers, TLS and proxy
  descs, error detail, a resolver, a wait set. The Apple side compiles clean
  with the `macos-metal` preset and passes `tests/spudnet_test` (run it with
  `tests/run_spudnet_test.sh build-macos-metal/spudnet_test`; it needs Python 3
  and `openssl`). The Windows and Linux backends have never been built with
  their own toolchains and have never run. `SPUDNET_TODO.md` lists what each
  part assumes and what the macOS run settled. Only TCP and the resolver have
  a caller outside this repo so far; HTTP and WebSocket are exercised by
  `tests/spudnet_test` alone. On Linux, WebSocket needs libcurl 8.11+ (older ones
  return `SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED`; HTTP works regardless).
- No CTest target exists. `tests/` holds two hardware tests, built behind
  `SPUDLIB_BUILD_TESTS` but deliberately not registered with ctest because each
  needs something real: `spudaudio_sine` (an audio device and someone listening)
  and `spudnet_test` (a local server, started by `tests/run_spudnet_test.sh`).
  SpudGPU, SpudFiles, SpudMemory and SpudPerf have no committed tests; SpudGPU is
  verified by running the `spudgpusamples` samples.
- No static/immutable sampler support. `spudgpu_sampler` (added alongside
  `SpudGPUDynamicIndexing`) only covers the dynamic, descriptor-bound case — a real
  `VkSampler` written into a descriptor set on Vulkan, a heap-slot `CreateSampler` on
  D3D12, an argument-buffer `MTLSamplerState` on Metal. D3D12's *static* samplers
  (baked into the root signature at pipeline-creation time, zero descriptor-heap cost)
  and Vulkan's *immutable* samplers (`VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding::pImmutableSamplers`,
  already stubbed at `spudgpuvulkandescriptors.c`'s `pImmutableSamplers = NULL; //
  Dynamic samplers only for now`) are a real, better-fitting mechanism for the common
  case of a small fixed set of samplers that never change for the life of a pipeline —
  worth adding as a genuinely separate concept alongside `spudgpu_sampler`, not a
  replacement for it (Metal has no equivalent distinction — a regular sampler bound
  once already is the zero-cost path there). Needs reconciling two different points in
  the object hierarchy: Vulkan's immutable samplers live on the descriptor-set-layout
  binding, D3D12's static samplers live on the pipeline/root-signature.
- `SPUDGPU_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER` doesn't work on Metal.
  Vulkan/D3D12 implement it; Metal's `spudgpumetaldescriptors.m` only ever
  wrote the texture half into the argument buffer (see that file's header
  comment), and cross-compiling a GLSL `sampler2D` confirms this isn't just
  an unfinished write path: under SpudGPU's per-descriptor-set-argument-
  buffer scheme, SPIRV-Cross's synthesized sampler member for a combined
  sampler overlaps the texture's own binding slot, which SPIRV-Cross only
  permits via "full mutable aliasing of argument buffer descriptors" on
  Metal 3+ (`spirv_msl.cpp`). `spudgpusamples/Samples/HelloTexture` hit this
  and works around it exactly the way `SpudGPUDynamicIndexing`'s bindless
  design already had to — a separate `SAMPLED_IMAGE` + `SAMPLER` pair instead
  of one combined descriptor. Fixing this for real means either targeting
  Metal 3+ only for this one descriptor type, or restructuring the Metal
  backend's argument-buffer layout so a combined descriptor's image and
  sampler occupy distinct member slots instead of sharing the caller's single
  binding number.
