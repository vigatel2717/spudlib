/**
 * @defgroup spudaudio SpudAudio
 * @brief Thin audio endpoint I/O (WASAPI / ALSA / CoreAudio): moves PCM
 * frames between the caller and an audio endpoint. Known problems: the
 * PipeWire backend is planned and not built
 * (SPUDAUDIO_NATIVE_API_PIPEWIRE returns SPUDRESULT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET);
 * and iOS, iPadOS and watchOS have no backend yet.
 *
 * A translation of the platform audio API, nothing more. No mixer, no
 * decoder, no resampler, no voice/sound objects, no 3D spatialisation, no
 * volume policy. All of that is the caller's problem, the same way SpudGPU
 * never decides what to draw.
 *
 * - Never picks a device. The OS default endpoints are reported as a
 *   property (SPUDAUDIO_DEVICE_PROPERTIES::default_roles); the caller
 *   decides whether to use them.
 * - Never silently converts formats. If the endpoint can't take the
 *   requested format, stream creation fails with
 *   SPUDRESULT_SAUD_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED. Platform-side conversion (WASAPI
 *   AUTOCONVERTPCM, ALSA plugins, a CoreAudio AudioConverter) is only
 *   enabled when the caller
 *   explicitly sets SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_FLAG_ALLOW_OS_CONVERSION, and refused
 *   where it can't happen - see SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_FLAGS.
 * - The data path is a callback, because that's the only model all three
 *   platforms share natively (CoreAudio has no acquire/release buffer API).
 *   On WASAPI/ALSA the backend owns the event-wait thread that drives it -
 *   plumbing, not policy.
 * - Spatialisation is rendering policy and so is the caller's. SpudAudio's
 *   only part in it is reporting which speaker each device channel feeds
 *   (SPUDAUDIO_FORMAT::positions, in a device's native format and in a
 *   stream's granted format), so the caller can render for the real speaker
 *   layout.

 * read back as AUX, and an ambisonic stream can't be described as one. That
 * would need a layout kind of its own (ambisonic order, channel ordering
 * and normalisation), not more position labels.
 *
 * An array rather than WASAPI's speaker bitmask because it's the
 * representation every backend can express: ALSA (snd_pcm_chmap_t) and
 * PipeWire take position arrays natively, CoreAudio an AudioChannelLayout
 * of per-channel labels, and a mask can't describe unlabeled channels or a
 * non-canonical order.
 *
 * The labels are the union of what the platforms use - PipeWire's set,
 * which is ALSA's full set plus LFE2, and which contains all 18 WASAPI
 * speakers and nearly all CoreAudio speaker labels. Names follow
 * PipeWire/ALSA: "R" is rear (WASAPI calls it back), and BC/BLC/BRC are
 * *bottom* positions (WASAPI's back center is RC). The 18 WASAPI speakers
 * come first, in WASAPI's bit order.
 *
 * - NA: a channel that exists but carries nothing (ALSA/PipeWire NA -
 *   common in HDMI maps). The only position that may repeat.
 * - AUX0..63: unlabeled channels that do carry signal (ALSA
 *   SND_CHMAP_UNKNOWN, PipeWire AUXn, WASAPI channels beyond the mask,
 *   CoreAudio Discrete_n).
 *
 * A format either has no layout (every position UNSPECIFIED) or a full
 * one (none UNSPECIFIED, no duplicates except NA, MONO only for 1
 * channel).
 *
 * A label a backend can't express makes the layout unsupported there -
 * never relabeled. The probe's suggestion then drops the layout (all
 * UNSPECIFIED), the one choice every backend accepts:
 *
 * - WASAPI: only MONO, FL..TRR, plus NA/AUX as trailing unassigned channels
 *   (WASAPI can't tell NA from AUX; both read back as AUX). Speakers must
 *   also be in ascending bit order with NA/AUX last - when only the order
 *   is wrong, the suggestion is the reordered layout instead.
 * - ALSA: everything except LFE2.
 * - CoreAudio: its non-speaker labels (matrix Lt/Rt, ambisonic W/X/Y/Z,
 *   haptic) have no position and read back as AUX.

 * - ALLOW_OS_CONVERSION: lets the platform convert between the requested
 *   format and the endpoint's. Without it the format must match exactly.
 *   Where conversion can't exist for this request, the flag is refused,
 *   never ignored:
 *   - WASAPI: shared mode uses AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_AUTOCONVERTPCM +
 *     SRC_DEFAULT_QUALITY. Exclusive mode has no conversion:
 *     SPUDRESULT_SAUD_OS_CONVERSION_UNAVAILABLE.
 *   - ALSA: conversion lives in plugins, so it comes from the PCM name the
 *     caller picked (plughw:, default, ...); the flag turns on
 *     snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_resample. PCMs that never convert (hw:,
 *     dmix, dsnoop, dshare) refuse it with
 *     SPUDRESULT_SAUD_OS_CONVERSION_UNAVAILABLE.
 *   - CoreAudio: the HAL converts nothing, so a format that isn't the
 *     device's goes through an AudioConverter (AudioToolbox) given the two
 *     formats and nothing else - no channel map, no mix, no quality
 *     setting. Sample format, sample rate and channel count may all
 *     differ. With a different channel count the converter's default
 *     applies: stream channel n is device channel n, and channels past the
 *     device's are discarded (OUTPUT) or silent (INPUT), so their position
 *     is NA. A format the converter refuses is
 *     SPUDRESULT_SAUD_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED. Works with EXCLUSIVE.
 *
 *     A converted CoreAudio stream is timed in its own frames: the callback
 *     always gets exactly period_frames, zero or more times per device I/O
 *     cycle, and the device's I/O buffer is set to the nearest whole number
 *     of device frames that lasts as long. host_time_ns and
 *     spudaudio_stream_get_latency_frames() leave out the converter's own
 *     delay. A format that already is the device's is not converted, flag
 *     or no flag.

 *   matching snd_pcm_query_chmaps entry, or the PCM's current map
 *   (snd_pcm_get_chmap), for positions.
 * - CoreAudio: BufferFrameSizeRange clamp; device nominal format. With
 *   ALLOW_OS_CONVERSION, a format that isn't the device's is put to

 *   comes to.

 * so. A lost device is always seen by polling
 * spudaudio_stream_get_status().
 *
 * An event is the platform's own notification, passed on:
 *
 * | Backend   | ADDED / REMOVED from                              | DEFAULT_CHANGED from                    |
 * |-----------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
 * | WASAPI    | IMMNotificationClient (endpoint state, add, remove) | IMMNotificationClient::OnDefaultDeviceChanged |
 * | CoreAudio | kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices                     | kAudioHardwarePropertyDefault{Output,SystemOutput,Input}Device |
 * | ALSA      | udev "sound" events, then the PCM name hints      | never - ALSA has no default to change   |
 *
 * What each backend can't see:
 * - CoreAudio: a device that stays but gains or loses its streams in one
 *   direction is not reported until the device list next changes.
 * - ALSA: a PCM name that comes from the ALSA configuration and not from a
 *   card only changes when a card does, since udev is the only trigger.
 *
 * ADDED and REMOVED are about the list spudaudio_enumerate_devices()
 * returns: ADDED is an endpoint that list now has and didn't, REMOVED one it
 * had and no longer does. Where the platform only says that something
 * changed (CoreAudio, ALSA), the backend compares the endpoints against the
 * ones it last saw and reports each difference. An endpoint that is both an
 * output and an input is two endpoints here, as it is when enumerated, and
 * gets an event per direction.
 *
 * Events start from the endpoints present when the callback is set: nothing
 * is reported for those. Set the callback first and enumerate second, and a
 * change in between shows up as an event for something the enumeration
 * already reflects, never as a change that was missed.
 *
 * An event only says that something changed. To get a handle for an added
 * endpoint, enumerate again: endpoints that are still there keep the handles
 * they had. Enumerations of one instance are not synchronized with each
 * other, so do that on the thread that enumerates, not inside the callback.
 *
 * Events and streams are independent. A stream on a removed device moves to
 * SPUDAUDIO_STREAM_STATE_DEVICE_LOST by itself (see
 * spudaudio_stream_get_status()), before or after REMOVED is reported, and
 * the caller decides whether and where to reopen it.
