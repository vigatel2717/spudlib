/*
 * SpudNet  —  the platform's network APIs behind one C interface
 *
 * Three parts, each a translation of what the platform already has:
 *
 *   Part             | Windows  | Linux       | Apple
 *   -----------------+----------+-------------+--------------
 *   TCP sockets      | Winsock2 | BSD sockets | BSD sockets
 *   HTTP client      | WinHTTP  | libcurl     | NSURLSession
 *   WebSocket client | WinHTTP  | libcurl (*) | NSURLSession
 *
 *   (*) libcurl 8.11 or later. Against an older one, or one built without
 *       WebSocket, spudnet_websocket_create returns
 *       SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED.
 *
 * On Linux all of SpudNet, the TCP sockets included, needs libcurl 7.84 or
 * later, built thread-safe: spudlib doesn't build against an older one, and
 * spudnet_instance_create returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED on one
 * that isn't thread-safe ("Instance" below has why).
 *
 * Not every part is on every platform: SPUDNET_EXT_TCP and
 * SPUDNET_EXT_WEBSOCKET, defined below this comment, say which of the
 * first and the last this build has. HTTP is on all of them.
 *
 * The HTTP and WebSocket clients don't sit on the TCP sockets here. TLS,
 * proxies and framing belong to the platform's client stack, and they
 * translate that stack directly.
 *
 * Pure transport, no protocol. SpudNet moves bytes, requests and messages
 * and nothing else. Message framing over a socket, what a status code or a
 * payload means, when to retry or reconnect, who has authority - all of
 * that is the caller's, the same way SpudGPU never decides what to draw.
 *
 * The same shape throughout:
 *
 * - Names are spudnet_<object>_<verb>: spudnet_tcp_socket_send,
 *   spudnet_http_client_create, spudnet_websocket_recv.
 * - Every object is an opaque handle made by its _create (a connected
 *   socket also by spudnet_tcp_listener_accept) and released by its
 *   _destroy, which takes NULL and does nothing with it. The caller owns
 *   it in between.
 * - Everything starts from a spudnet_instance ("Instance" below). The
 *   _create calls that make an object from nothing take one; an object
 *   made from another object (an accepted socket, an HTTP transfer) is its
 *   parent's instance's. There is nothing to call once per process.
 * - Anything with more than a couple of inputs takes a desc struct.
 *   Nothing in one has a default: SpudNet never picks an address, a port, a
 *   backlog, a time limit or a size limit for the caller.
 * - Strings and buffers passed in are only read during the call.
 * - Every call returns at once or blocks the thread it was made on; SpudNet
 *   starts no thread and has no non-blocking mode ("Threads" below). A
 *   call that can wait takes a time limit ("Time limits" below) and can be
 *   ended from another thread by the object's _abort.
 * - Failures are SPUDRESULT values: the general ones, and the
 *   SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_* group in spudcore.h. What the platform itself
 *   reported behind one is kept and can be read back ("Error detail").
 */

/*
 * Which parts this build has.
 *
 * spudlib is built for one platform at a time, and the build says which by
 * defining one of SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_WIN32, SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_LINUX and
 * SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_APPLE as 1. The last covers every Apple system, and
 * SpudNet has to tell one of them apart, so a build for Apple Watch also
 * defines SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_WATCHOS as 1. Anything not defined is 0.
 *
 *   SPUDNET_EXT_TCP        TCP sockets and listeners, the resolver that
 *                          finds addresses for them, the local address
 *                          query, and a wait set's calls for both.
 *   SPUDNET_EXT_WEBSOCKET  The WebSocket client, and a wait set's calls
 *                          for it.
 *
 * Each is 1 where the platform lets an ordinary application use that part
 * and 0 where it doesn't, and everything belonging to a part is declared
 * only when its macro is 1 - so code that uses a part the platform doesn't
 * have fails to compile there, rather than building and then failing on
 * the device. Code that is shared between platforms tests the macro, and
 * never a platform's name: if a second platform comes to lack a part, that
 * is one line changed here and nothing to hunt for anywhere else.
 *
 *   Platform                 | TCP | WebSocket
 *   -------------------------+-----+----------
 *   Windows                  |  1  |  1
 *   Linux                    |  1  |  1 (*)
 *   Apple other than watchOS |  1  |  1
 *   watchOS                  |  0  |  0
 *
 *   (*) The macro says the platform has it. Whether the libcurl spudlib
 *       was built against does is found out when spudnet_websocket_create
 *       is called (SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED).
 *
 * watchOS: everything below HTTP is closed to most applications there.
 * BSD sockets and NSURLSession's WebSocket task both exist in its SDK, so
 * code that uses them compiles, and both are refused when the application
 * runs; the system only lets them through for a few kinds of application
 * (one streaming audio, chiefly). What an ordinary application has is
 * HTTP, which is what is left here. 0 is therefore a statement about what
 * the system allows rather than about what SpudNet has written, and it
 * shuts out the excepted kinds of application along with the rest.

/*
 * Threads — every one of them is the caller's.
 *
 * - SpudNet starts no thread. A call runs on the thread that made it, for
 *   as long as it takes or its time limit allows. Where work has to go on
 *   while the caller does something else, the caller brings the thread:
 *   how many there are, what they cost and when they end is not SpudNet's
 *   to decide. (The platform's HTTP stack has threads of its own. They are
 *   the stack's, and nothing of the caller's ever runs on them.)
 * - Nothing here calls back. No function pointer is taken anywhere in this
 *   header, so no code of the caller's runs anywhere but where the caller
 *   called from.
 * - No object belongs to a thread. Any thread may use one, and a different
 *   thread next time; what each object limits is how many may be inside it
 *   at once, and its own section says so (one receiver and one sender on a
 *   socket, one thread on an HTTP transfer, one on a wait set).
 * - The calls that may come from any thread at any time are the ones that
 *   end a wait - every _abort, and spudnet_wait_set_wake - and no others
 *   ("Aborting" below, and "Wait set").
 * - Taking an object apart is always the same three steps: abort it, wait
 *   for the caller's own threads to come back out of it, destroy it. The
 *   one exception is the resolver, whose lookup can't be brought back and
 *   whose destroy is made not to need it ("Resolver" below).
 */

/*
 * Error detail — what the platform reported behind a failed call.
 *
 * A SPUDRESULT is the same on every platform, which is its use and its
 * limit: a network failure has its cause on another machine, may not happen
 * twice, and the one number that says what it was is the platform's own.
 * Each object keeps that number for its most recent failure, and its
 * _get_error hands it over. It is for a log or a report; what to do next is
 * decided from the SPUDRESULT, which is why nothing here is portable.
 *
 * What is kept, and when:
 *
 * - Only a failure that came from the platform is recorded. A refused
 *   argument, SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT and SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_ABORTED
 *   are SpudNet's own doing and leave what was there alone - so does a
 *   call that succeeds. A loop polling with
 *   SPUDNET_NO_WAIT doesn't wear the record of a real failure away.
 * - `result` is the SPUDRESULT the recorded call returned. A caller that
 *   just got a failure compares the two to know the detail is that call's
 *   and not an older one's.
 * - A TCP socket and a WebSocket keep two records, because one thread may
 *   be sending while another receives: SPUDNET_ERROR_SIDE says which.
 * - _get_error is called under the same rule as the calls it reports on -
 *   by the thread that made the failed call, or one that knows that thread
 *   is not in such a call now. It never waits, and it takes NULL (the
 *   record comes back empty).
 *
 * A call that fails without leaving an object to ask - spudnet_instance_create,
 * spudnet_get_local_ipv4_addresses, spudnet_tcp_listener_create - takes an
 * `out_error` instead, which may be NULL. The other _create calls fail only
 * for want of memory or over a bad desc, and take none.

 * Instance — where all three parts start.
 *
 * Two of the platforms have something to start before their networking
 * can be used and to stop when it is done with: Winsock (WSAStartup,
 * WSACleanup) and libcurl (its global init and cleanup). On Apple there is
 * nothing. A spudnet_instance is that start held by a caller: creating one
 * makes the platform's call, destroying it makes the matching one, and
 * every object in this header is made, directly or through its parent,
 * with an instance that outlasts it.
 *
 * - There is no call to make once per process, and no moment that has to
 *   come before the process's other threads. A part of a program that
 *   uses SpudNet makes an instance of its own and need not know whether
 *   any other part has one.
 * - Any number of instances may exist at once. The platform counts its
 *   starts and keeps its networking up until the last is given back;
 *   SpudNet itself keeps no count and no state of its own, here or
 *   anywhere.
 * - spudnet_instance_create and spudnet_instance_destroy may be called
 *   from any thread, at the same time as each other and as any other call
 *   in this header - on other instances. On one instance they are like any
 *   other object's: nothing else is in it while it is destroyed.
 * - An instance is destroyed after every object made with it. One
 *   destroyed sooner is the caller's mistake and isn't caught. The one
 *   object that may still be at work is a resolver whose lookup hasn't
 *   returned: it has been destroyed as far as the caller is concerned, and
 *   it holds the platform's networking for itself until it is done
 *   ("Resolver" below).
 * - Objects are used with others of their own instance: a wait set takes
 *   members made with the instance it was made with, and refuses any other
 *   (SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_INVALID_INSTANCE).
 * - A NULL instance given to a _create is
 *   SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_INVALID_INSTANCE.
 *
 * libcurl. Its global init is only safe to make while other threads are
 * running since 7.84, and only in a libcurl built thread-safe (it says so
 * itself: CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE). An instance that may be made at any
 * time, by a part of the program that doesn't know what the rest is doing,
 * needs exactly that, so SpudNet requires it rather than pass the old rule
 * on to its callers: spudlib builds against libcurl 7.84 or later only,
 * and spudnet_instance_create returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED when
 * the libcurl it finds at run time isn't thread-safe. Nothing of SpudNet
 * works on Linux without an instance, so that includes the TCP sockets.

 *
 * It is the longest the whole call may take, in milliseconds, counted by
 * SpudNet from the moment the call is made: for a call with several stages
 * (connecting, TLS, sending, receiving) all of them come out of the one
 * allowance. The platforms' own timers - which differ: per stage, per idle
 * stretch, whole seconds - are switched off wherever they can be, and never
 * used to keep the caller's limit. A call that runs out returns
 * SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT, and that result means this and nothing
 * else: the limit the caller gave is what ended the call.
 *
 * SPUDNET_NO_WAIT (0) means the call may not wait at all. It does whatever
 * can be done on the spot and returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT if that
 * is nothing:
 *
 * - spudnet_tcp_socket_recv, spudnet_websocket_recv and
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_recv hand over what has already arrived;
 *   spudnet_tcp_listener_accept, a connection already waiting;
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_receive_response, a response that has already
 *   come.
 * - spudnet_tcp_socket_send and spudnet_http_transfer_send send as much as
 *   will be taken right now.
 * - The calls that can't finish without the other side answering -
 *   spudnet_tcp_socket_connect, spudnet_http_transfer_start,
 *   spudnet_websocket_connect, and spudnet_websocket_send (a message half
 *   sent can't be taken back) - do nothing, change nothing and return
 *   SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT.
 *
 * This is what replaces a non-blocking mode: a loop that can't stall (a
 * host's frame loop) passes SPUDNET_NO_WAIT.
 *
 * SPUDNET_WAIT_FOREVER means SpudNet sets no limit. The call still ends
 * when the network does - the operating system gives up on a connection
 * that never answers, a peer closes - or when it is aborted. It never
 * returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT.
 *
 * Somebody else's timer. SpudNet's clock is not the only one running:
 * under every call there is the operating system, which stops waiting for
 * a peer that has gone silent, and under the HTTP and WebSocket calls
 * there is the client stack as well. When one of those gives up first -
 * with time still left on the caller's limit, or with no limit at all - it
 * is not the caller's limit that ran out, and the call says so with a
 * result of its own, by which part it was made on:
 *
 *   SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_SYSTEM_TIMED_OUT  from a TCP socket call. The
 *       operating system gave up on the other end: a connect nobody
 *       answered (a minute or so, by the system's own settings), or an
 *       established connection whose peer stopped acknowledging.
 *   SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_STACK_TIMED_OUT   from an HTTP transfer or a
 *       WebSocket call. The stack reported a time-out: its own, or the
 *       system's passed up - the stacks don't reliably say which, so both
 *       come back as this one.
 *
 * Either is a failure like any other from the network: the connection or
 * the request is over, only destroy is left, and the object's _get_error
 * has the platform's own code for it. What they add is a difference a
 * caller can act on. "Nobody answered" is usually worth another attempt in
 * a way that "refused" (SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_CONNECT_FAILED) or a turned-away
 * certificate is not - and neither means the caller should have waited
 * longer, which is what SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT is left to mean.
 *
 * How long somebody else's timer runs is not SpudNet's to set, and it is
 * not the same everywhere. Where a stack's timer can't be switched off it
 * is set as long as the stack accepts, which is the ceiling on a call made
 * with SPUDNET_WAIT_FOREVER:
 *
 *   Part                          | Longest a call can wait
 *   ------------------------------+--------------------------------------
 *   TCP sockets                   | no ceiling; the system's own patience
 *   HTTP, WebSocket: WinHTTP      | no ceiling; its timers switch off
 *   HTTP, WebSocket: libcurl      | about 25 days, while connecting only
 *   HTTP, WebSocket: NSURLSession | one year, for a transfer or a socket
 *
 * In practice the operating system has long since given up on anything
 * that would get near the last two.

 * send/recv), not a networking framework. Plain TCP over IPv4 or IPv6, no
 * TLS: anything that has to be private or authenticated goes through the
 * HTTP or WebSocket client further down.
 *
 * Two objects. A spudnet_tcp_listener waits for incoming connections on one
 * address and port. A spudnet_tcp_socket is one connection, made either by
 * spudnet_tcp_listener_accept or by spudnet_tcp_socket_create followed by one
 * spudnet_tcp_socket_connect. A socket is good for one connection: after
 * connect fails, or the connection ends, only destroy is left.
 *
 * Addresses are numeric: "192.168.1.20", "127.0.0.1", "::1". The calls
 * that take one never look a name up, because the system's lookup can be
 * neither given a time limit nor interrupted, and a connect that hid one
 * couldn't keep its own. Turning a host name into addresses is its own
 * object, the spudnet_resolver below, and which of the answers to use is

 *
 * send and recv mirror the underlying socket calls: either can transfer
 * fewer bytes than asked for. A caller that wants "exactly N bytes or

 * Threads: on one socket, one thread may be in spudnet_tcp_socket_recv while
 * another is in spudnet_tcp_socket_send. Two receivers at once or two senders
 * at once are the caller's to prevent, as is more than one thread in

 * Resolver — a host name's addresses, from the operating system's resolver.
 *
 * The system's lookup (getaddrinfo) blocks for as long as it takes -
 * usually milliseconds, up to its own give-up time when a name server
 * isn't answering - and on most platforms nothing can make it return
 * sooner. A time limit and an abort can therefore only be had by not being
 * the thread that is stuck in it. So a lookup here is two calls, meant for
 * two threads, and both threads are the caller's ("Threads" above):
 *
 * - spudnet_resolver_run does the lookup. It blocks until the system has
 *   answered and keeps the answer in the resolver. It goes on a thread the
 *   caller can afford to leave in there.
 * - spudnet_resolver_wait waits for that answer, with a time limit and an
 *   abort like every other wait in this header, and copies it out. It goes
 *   on the thread that wants the addresses.
 *
 * What SpudNet adds is the part in between that is easy to get wrong: the
 * answer has to be somewhere both threads can reach and neither can pull
 * out from under the other, whichever finishes first. That is the
 * resolver. It stays until both of two things have happened, in either
 * order: its run has returned, and it has been destroyed. A waiter that
 * gives up destroys it and walks away while the lookup is still out; a
 * lookup that finishes first leaves the answer for the waiter. So:
 *
 *   EVERY RESOLVER IS RUN EXACTLY ONCE AND DESTROYED EXACTLY ONCE.
 *
 * A resolver that turns out not to be needed - the thread for it couldn't
 * be started - is still run: abort it first and spudnet_resolver_run
 * returns at once without looking anything up. Then destroy it.
 *
 * A caller with nothing better to do than wait makes both calls on one
 * thread, run and then wait, and has an ordinary blocking lookup.
 *
 * The usual two-thread use:
 *
 *   spudnet_resolver_create(instance, &desc, &resolver);
 *   start_my_thread(lookup_thread, resolver);   // calls spudnet_resolver_run(resolver), nothing else
 *   result = spudnet_resolver_wait(resolver, 2000, addresses, 8, &count);
 *   spudnet_resolver_destroy(resolver);         // whether or not it timed out
 *   // the thread ends by itself when the system resolver lets it go
 *
 * The instance. Since the lookup may still be out when the caller has
 * destroyed the resolver and gone on to destroy the instance it was made
 * with, a resolver doesn't lean on the instance's start of the platform's
 * networking: where the lookup needs one (Winsock) it takes one of its own
 * when it is made and gives it back when it is freed. Destroying the
 * instance after the resolver is therefore in order whether or not the
 * lookup has returned.
 *
 * Threads: one in spudnet_resolver_run, ever. One at a time in
 * spudnet_resolver_wait and spudnet_resolver_get_error, and those have
 * come back before spudnet_resolver_destroy - the thread in run is the one

/*
 * HTTP and WebSocket  —  the platform's own client stack
 * (WinHTTP / NSURLSession / libcurl)
 *
 * TLS and HTTP versions are the platform stack's. Which certificates a
 * server may present, and whether a proxy stands between here and it, are
 * the caller's to say, in a spudnet_tls_desc and a spudnet_proxy_desc
 * ("TLS" and "Proxy" below). SpudNet carries one request or one
 * message at a time and nothing else: no retry, no redirect unless
 * asked for, no cookies, no stored credentials, no cache, no reconnect, no
 * keep-alive pings of its own. It holds none of the caller's data either:
 * a body, in either direction, passes through in the pieces the caller
 * moves it in, and is never gathered up here. What a status code or a
 * message means is the caller's.
 *
 * The calls here that can wait are spudnet_http_transfer_start, _send,
 * _receive_response and _recv, and spudnet_websocket_connect, _send and
 * _recv; each takes a time limit and can be ended from another thread, as
 * "Time limits" and "Aborting" above describe. The rest return without
 * waiting on the network. No time limit has a default.
 *
 * Host names. A URL here names its host, and the stack looks that name up
 * itself - unlike a TCP socket, which is given a numeric address and has
 * the spudnet_resolver to get one. The two differ because what kept the
 * lookup out of spudnet_tcp_socket_connect doesn't hold here: the stack's
 * lookup is part of the call that needed it, comes out of that call's time
 * limit and ends with its abort. And the stack can't do without the name,
 * which goes to the server in the request and in the TLS handshake and is
 * what the server's certificate is checked against.
 *
 * What the caller doesn't get is the choice a resolver gives: where a name
 * has several addresses, or both an IPv4 and an IPv6 one, which is used is
 * the stack's to pick. A URL may give a numeric address in place of a name
 * ("http://192.168.1.20:8080/", "http://[::1]/"), which is then the one
 * used; over TLS the server's certificate has to be for that address, or
 * the spudnet_tls_desc has to say how else the server is known.
 *
 * Two things are the stack's and can't be turned off evenly across
 * platforms, so they are the same everywhere instead: a compressed
 * response body arrives decoded, and the stack adds its own standard
 * request headers (Host, Accept-Encoding, on some platforms User-Agent and
 * Accept) where the caller set none.
 *
 * Decoding can't be switched off - NSURLSession has no way to hand over a
 * body still compressed - but compression can be declined, which comes to
 * the same thing and works on every stack. A caller that needs a response
 * body byte for byte as the server holds it sends the request header
 *
 *   Accept-Encoding: identity
 *
 * which tells the server to send it as it is. The stack then sends that
 * in place of its own Accept-Encoding, nothing arrives compressed, and
 * there is nothing to decode. That is what a download wants when it will
 * be resumed (a Range counts bytes as they are sent, so it only lines up
 * with what was received if the two are the same bytes), or checked
 * against a size or a hash somebody published. Everything else - an API
 * reply above all - is better left alone, smaller on the wire and decoded
 * on arrival.
 *
 * `identity` is the one value of Accept-Encoding a caller may send. Any
 * other would have the caller choosing compressions for a decoder it
 * doesn't own, with a result that differs by stack, and is refused
 * (SPUDRESULT_DESC_INVALID_PARAMETERS).

 * for sense there even when the URL turns out to be http:// or ws://, where
 * it then has nothing to act on.
 *
 * Three questions, answered separately:
 *
 * - `trust`: which roots a certificate chain has to end at.
 * - `skip_host_name_check`: whether the certificate has to be for the host
 *   in the URL.
 * - `pins`: whether the server's own key has to be one of a known few, on
 *   top of whatever the first two let through.
 *
 * A zeroed desc is the stack's own behaviour with nothing added: the system
 * trust store, the host name checked, no pins.
 *
 * A server with a self-signed certificate is reached one of three ways:
 * its certificate given as the one root (SPUDNET_TLS_TRUST_ROOTS - it is

 * SPUDRESULT_DESC_INVALID_PARAMETERS from the call it was handed to, as is
 * a root that isn't a certificate. SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED means the
 * stack can't do what was asked - only libcurl can say that, of one built
 * with a TLS library that lacks roots from memory or pinning.

 * Two objects. A spudnet_http_client holds the stack's connections, so
 * that requests to one server reuse them. A spudnet_http_transfer is one
 * request and its response, made on a client.
 *
 * A transfer moves its bodies the way a TCP socket moves bytes: the caller
 * sends the request body in pieces and receives the response body in
 * pieces, each call taking or giving what there is, and nothing is held in
 * between. A file goes up or comes down in a buffer's worth of memory
 * whatever its size, the caller knows how far along it is because it is
 * the one counting, and "how much is too much" is the caller's to decide by
 * no longer asking for more. A caller that wants a small body as one block
 * loops on recv into a buffer of its own; SpudNet won't do it for you.
 *
 * The order of use, each step once and in this order:
 *
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_create            a transfer, on a client
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_start             the request line and headers
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_send              the request body, until all of
 *                                           it is in (skipped when there is
 *                                           none, or none to send)
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_receive_response  ends the request, waits for the
 *                                           status and headers
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_get_status, _get_header, ...
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_recv              the response body, until it
 *                                           returns 0 bytes
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_destroy
 *
 * A call made out of that order (other than abort, get_error and destroy)
 * returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_INVALID_HTTP_TRANSFER. A transfer is good for
 * one request: after any call on it fails - other than by running out of
 * time where that call's own comment says it may be tried again - only
 * destroy is left.
 *
 * Time limits belong to each call, as everywhere in this header. There is
 * none for the exchange as a whole; a caller that has one keeps it, and
 * passes each call what is left of it.
 *
 * A transfer and its client:
 *
 * - One transfer at a time per client, from its start until it is
 *   destroyed. Transfers that run side by side want a client each.
 * - Destroying a transfer whose response body was received to its end
 *   hands its connection back to the client for the next one. Destroying
 *   it any earlier drops the connection, which is also how a response
 *   nobody wants the rest of is stopped.
 * - A transfer is destroyed before its client.
 *
 * Threads: one at a time in a transfer; it has no sending side and
 * receiving side to share out, since a request is sent before its response
 * is read. spudnet_http_transfer_abort is the exception, as every _abort
 * is.

 *
 * Every waiting call above waits on one object. A wait set is how one
 * thread waits on several - a server's listener and all its connections -
 * without a thread for each and without circling them with SPUDNET_NO_WAIT.
 * It is the platform's poll() (WSAPoll on Windows) over the objects' own

 * spudnet_wait_set_wait only says which objects are worth calling, and the
 * caller then makes the ordinary calls on them with SPUDNET_NO_WAIT.
 *
 * TCP sockets, TCP listeners and WebSockets can be in one. An HTTP
 * transfer can't.
 *
 * How to use one, which is the same as for epoll or kqueue used carefully:
 *
 * - After spudnet_wait_set_wait names an object, call it with
 *   SPUDNET_NO_WAIT until it returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT, and only
 *   then wait again. A stack can hold more than it had when it woke the
 *   set - a WebSocket hands a message over in parts - and whether the
 *   leftover would be reported a second time differs between them. Draining
 *   is the one rule that is right on all of them.
 * - Being named is a reason to try, not a promise. The first try after a
 *   wake can itself return SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT (libcurl's
 *   WebSocket is always named once after it is added, since what it has
 *   already read can't be asked about), and that is not an error.
 * - An object that has ended - aborted, closed by the peer, broken - is
 *   named too. The call made on it then says which, and the caller removes
 *   it.
 *
 * Whose is what:
 *
 * - The set doesn't own its objects. An object is removed from its set
 *   before it is destroyed; destroying the set first removes whatever is
 *   still in it.
 * - One thread at a time in a set's add, remove, wait and destroy.
 *   spudnet_wait_set_abort is the exception, as every _abort is, and so is
 *   spudnet_wait_set_wake.
 * - While an object is in a set, its receiving side is the waiting
 *   thread's: no other thread is in recv or accept on it. Sending from
 *   another thread carries on as before.
 * - An object goes in one set at a time.
